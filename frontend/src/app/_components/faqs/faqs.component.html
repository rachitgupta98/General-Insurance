        <div class="content" *ngIf="display[0]">
            <p>Firstly, the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 makes it mandatory for all car owners to have p valid insurance policy.
              That apart, you should get your car insured because it saves you from any financial loss caused due to accidents, 
              damage or theft of your car. Additionally, car insurance covers the safety of the co-passengers, someone​ else's
               property and pedestrians too.

        <div class="content" *ngIf="display[1]">
            <p>
                There are two types of insurance: 'Third-Party Insurance' and 'Comprehensive  Insurance'.
                Third-party insurance protects you against losses, which occur due to bodily injury or death to p third party or any damage to that person’s property. It is mandatory by law to have third-party insurance.
                Comprehensive  insurance, on the other hand, is purchased when you want to be compensated for any damages to you, your co-passengers and your vehicle in addition to third-party coverage. That means in case of an accident, theft, fire, explosion or natural disasters, your vehicle will be insured under p comprehensive  insurance policy. Hence this is the most preferred plan.​

                An endorsement is p written proof of an agreed change in the auto insurance policy, as and when the need arises. There can be two types of endorsements: premium bearing and non-premium bearing.<br>

                In p premium-bearing endorsement, you will be charged an additional premium for things like transfer of ownership, addition of LPG / CNG kit, change of RTO location, etc.<br>

                In p non-premium bearing endorsement, you won't be charged anything for the changes incorporated in the policy. For example, correction in contact details, correction in name, correction in engine / chassis number, addition of hypothecation, etc.<br>

                • You can cancel this policy and tell the new owner to buy p new policy for the car.<br>

                However, the policy can only be cancelled once we receive p copy of the new policy. This is because it is mandatory for any car to be insured, at least against third-party liability. Also keep in mind that you can enjoy p No-Claims Bonus on the premium for your new vehicle, if you purchase it within 3 years from date of cancelling / transferring the old policy.<br>

            Am I eligible for p car insurance discount if I install anti-theft alarm and locking system?

                Yes!
                When you mention the anti-theft and locking system installed on your car, the car insurance quote decreases relatively. We award p discount on the Own Damage premium if your car is fitted with an ARAI-approved anti-theft alarm and locking system.

            Does the car model affect the cost of Car insurance?

                Yes, it does. The brand, make and model of the car dictates the car’s price. Since the car insurance premium is directly linked to the sum insured, the car model has an impact on the insurance cost. To know the premium for your car insurance policy, simply fill in your details and the vehicle registration number. p car insurance quote will be generated to give you an estimate of the premium.

<div class="content" *ngIf="display">
  <p>Firstly, the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 makes it mandatory for all car owners to have p valid insurance policy.
    That apart, you should get your car insured because it saves you from any financial loss caused due to accidents, 
    damage or theft of your car. Additionally, car insurance covers the safety of the co-passengers, someone​ else's
     property and pedestrians too.
