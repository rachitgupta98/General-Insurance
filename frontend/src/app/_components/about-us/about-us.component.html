              <p >Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited is a joint venture between Allianz SE, the world’s leading insurer, and Bajaj Finserv Limited. The Company received the certificate of registration from IRDA on 2nd May 2001 to conduct general insurance business in India. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, today, is one of the largest private insurer in the industry with offices in over 1100 towns and cities. The Company has continuously been expanding its operations to reach out to its customers.

                The Company recently changed its brand identity to ‘Caringly Yours’ to reposition itself in the minds of Indian consumers as a brand that protects and cares about customer’s financial worries around their most prized possessions - their health, home & content, vehicles, businesses etc. With this, the Company not just aims to take its service to the next level, but also seeks to provide the best customer experience at every touchpoint and make insurance a pull rather than a push product. 
                
                Bajaj Allianz General Insurance caters to individuals across demographics of the country and the corporate sector with its wide range of products and services that go beyond insurance. </p>
